<!-- # Live Demo -->

<!-- # Thesis Administrative Questions -->

<!-- > how many months will the actual project be and when exactly (if it is already fixed) -->

<!-- Regulations say 18 weeks, with max. 6 weeks extensions under exceptional circumstances. -->

<!-- > what are the exact formal requirements for the thesis from your university (number of hours per week, topic, ...) -->

<!-- - Hours per week: the thesis is 30 credit points, so 50 to 40 hours per week. -->
<!-- - Topic: no official restrictios. language: English. -->
<!-- - Colloquium may be held before submission of thesis. -->
<!-- - Registration process: may delay possible start to November. Because exam session here ends with October. -->
<!-- - external supervisor: must have a university degree. -->
<!-- - a time schedule must be worked out beforehand and handed in to the examination board before approval -->

<!-- # Thesis Administrative Questions -->

<!-- > will there be an official supervisor from Aachen? Do you already know who this could be? -->

<!-- Yes. It must be a professor of one of the departments affiliated with my course of study. Prof. Blügel would be suitable and I think willing. Other options can be explored. -->

<!-- > will you be done with all exams and work 100% of your working time on the thesis, or will you have other duties (e.g. pending exams or projects) in parallel? (It’s not a problem if it’s less than 100%, as long as we know what to expect) -->

<!-- Yes, if I pass all exams in summer, I will have one exam to finish in February / March, High Performance Computing, 6 credit points. -->

<!-- I can list all detailed regulations on request in a mail. -->
